Continuous integration and deployment on Raspberry Pi

A tutorial on continuous integration and deployment on Raspberry Pi machine. This tutorial targets to connect the dots to have successful CI/CD pipeline for an application. In this tutorial, we're building a minimal flask application which can be deployed to our Raspberry Pi machine with just a push to GitHub repo.

Pre-requisites

    A GitHub repository where you can host your source code and then use GitHub actions to push the code to Raspberry Pi.
    Raspberry Pi setup so that we can connect to it using SSH from a dev machine.
    A stable internet connection, which I'm sure you have as you're reading this page.
